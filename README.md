# Flight-Fare-Prediction

This is an end to end project on Flight fare prediction using Machine learning. Basically the dataset focusses on data which is collected in 2019. The project is implemented using machine learning algorithms such as ExtraTreesRegressor, Random Forest and hyperparameter tuning is done with Randomized Search CV. I have used Flask as a backend framework. HTML and CSS is used for front end of the website.
